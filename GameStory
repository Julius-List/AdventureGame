You wake up. Your mouth is dry, your body aches, and... you're lost in a fog of confusion. Who are you? 
Slowly, you sit up, feeling the sand clinging to your skin uncomfortably. What happened, why are you here?
Your eyes drift around, trying to make sense of your surroundings. A beach, that much is clear. But you're alone, with no one but the waves for company. 
Is this a bad dream, some version of cast away? You look down around you. Sadly, no Willson to keep you company. 

One thing you do know is that you're stranded. The only options are to stay or... well, you don't want to think about that. 
The question is, what do you do now?
